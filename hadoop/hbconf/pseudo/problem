Start and stop additional RegionServers

The HRegionServer manages the data in its StoreFiles as directed by the HMaster. 
Generally, one HRegionServer runs per node in the cluster. 
Running multiple HRegionServers on the same system can be useful for testing in pseudo-distributed mode. 
The local-regionservers.sh command allows you to run multiple RegionServers. 
It works in a similar way to the local-master-backup.sh command, in that each parameter you provide represents the port offset for an instance. 
Each RegionServer requires two ports, and the default ports are 16020 and 16030. 
However, the base ports for additional RegionServers are not the default ports since the default ports are used by the HMaster, which is also a RegionServer since HBase version 1.0.0. 
The base ports are 16200 and 16300 instead. 
You can run 99 additional RegionServers that are not a HMaster or backup HMaster, on a server. 
The following command starts four additional RegionServers, running on sequential ports starting at 16202/16302 (base ports 16200/16300 plus 

2).

$ .bin/local-regionservers.sh start 2 3 4 5            
To stop a RegionServer manually, use the local-regionservers.sh command with the stop parameter and the offset of the server to stop.
$ .bin/local-regionservers.sh stop 3



start-hbasem.sh
local-regionservers.sh start 2 3 4 5            
local-regionservers.sh stop 2 3 4 5
